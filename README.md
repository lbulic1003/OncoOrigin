### OncoOrigin: An Integrative AI Tool for Primary Cancer Site Prediction

OncoOrigin is an integrative genetics-based AI tool intended for primary cancer site prediction based on tumor DNA sequencing data. The software is based on a machine-learning model trained on a large collection of tumor samples with DNA sequencing results and a graphical user interface designed for feature input (user -> model) and prediction output (model -> user). The aim of this software is to provide a novel diagnostic tool and aid oncology patients diagnosed with cancers of unknown primary origin. Based on these predictions, more detailed and focused diagnostic and therapeutic approaches might be considered appropriate and could potentially lead to better outcomes for the patients.
